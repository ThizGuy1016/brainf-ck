# brainf-ck

This library will soon be host to a collection of brainf-ck compilers and interpreters as sort of a personal portfolio.

But it's April fools day (as of writing this) so I thought I would release my half-baked Python brainf-ck interpreter.
Compilation for x86_64 linux is coming soon and might be out before the end of the day.

Included in the Python folder is the interpreter itself as well as a hello.bf file so the people not familiar with bf (smart people) don't have to suffer.
